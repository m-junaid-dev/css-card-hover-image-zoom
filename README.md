 # CSS Card Hover Image Zoom Effect

This project demonstrates a modern product card design using pure HTML and CSS.  
The card includes a smooth image zoom effect on hover, similar to ecommerce websites, where the image scales inside the card without overflowing outside the container.

## Features

- Clean and modern card UI
- Image zoom effect on hover
- Image stays inside the card container
- Smooth CSS transitions
- No JavaScript used
- Beginner friendly code structure

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Transforms
- CSS Transitions

## Key Concepts Covered

- CSS hover effects
- transform: scale()
- overflow: hidden
- Parent-child hover relationship
- Card UI layout
- Box model
- Responsive design basics

## How the Image Zoom Effect Works

The image zoom effect is achieved by:
- Wrapping the image inside a container div
- Applying overflow: hidden to the image container
- Scaling the image using transform: scale()
- Triggering the effect when hovering over the parent container

This ensures the image zooms smoothly while staying inside the card boundaries.
